Try using the ```<img>``` element to add more pictures you find on the internet!

To add an image from the internet to your website you need to find the image address (place it is stored). 

Right click on your chosen image and select **Copy image address**:
![Windows right-click context menu showing highlighted copy image address menu item](images/imageaddress.png)

Right-click and ‘Paste’ your image address into the **src** attribute in the ```<img>``` tag. Update your alt-text to fit the image.
Your code will look something like this:    
```html
<img src="https://raspberrypifactfiles.org/blog/images/portraits/Katherine_Johnson_1.jpg" alt="image of Katherine Johnson taken in 1991">
```
