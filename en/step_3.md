### The First Content
Use the website body to add a heading and paragraphs.

--- task ---
Find the `<body>` element in your code. This element contains all the other elements we want to be displayed on the website. 

Inside the <body> element are some heading elements. The biggest heading on a webpage has the tag <h1>. There are six sizes of heading from <h1> down to <h6>. How many heading elements can you find in the code for your website?

--- task ---
**Choose:** a `<h1>` **heading** for your website. Think of something exciting about your Computer Scientist that would make people want to look at your page. 

Find the `<h1>` tag and update the information to show your new heading. We chose:

```html
<h1>Rear Admiral Grace Hopper</h1>
```

**Test:** Look at your website on the right of your code. As you type your website will update to show your changes.

The <body> element contains some paragraphs. A paragraph uses the tags `<p>` and `</p>`. 

--- task ---
Find the first paragraph in your code. Write a paragraph to introduce your inspiring Computer Scientist. We wrote:

```html
<p>Rear Admiral Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist who was born in 1906 in New York City.</p>
```

The `<span>` element can be used to highlight important information. We have used the `<span>` element to highlight important text in dark grey. 

**Choose:** find a few important words in your first paragraph that you would like to highlight then add a ```<span>``` tag. 

Remember when you add a start tag you also add an end ```</span>``` tag. Some code editors will automatically add this for you, if this happens just move your text between the start and end tags:

```html
<p>Rear Admiral <span> Grace Brewster Murray Hopper </span> was an American computer scientist
who was born in 1906 in New York City. </p>
```

Find the next paragraph ```<p>``` in your code. Use this to add some more information about your chosen Computer Scientist. 

Add ```<span>``` tags to any information you want to highlight:

```html
<p>Even when she was very young, Grace was curious about all sorts of things. At the
age of seven, she wanted to know how her alarm clock worked, so she <span>dismantled
seven clocks</span> in the house to see inside them before her mother could stop her! After
that, she was only allowed to pull apart her own clock.
</p>
